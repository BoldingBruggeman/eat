## Using EAT with GOTM as model.

The Northern North Sea standard GOTM test case has been used for the development of a GOTM component to EAT.

The case is identical to the standard case except an ensemble of 11 members has been generated by creating 11 different gotm.yaml configuration files. They only differ in the scale\_factor for u10 and v10.

## Ensemble simulation.
mpiexec -np 11 ~/source/build/gcc/9/eat/src/eat_gotm_model

## Ensemble simulation with time periods provided by observation program.
mpiexec -np 1 ~/source/build/gcc/9/eat/src/eat_observations : -np 5 ~/source/build/gcc/9/eat/src/eat_gotm_model
